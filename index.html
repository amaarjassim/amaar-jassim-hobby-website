  <title>Amaar's Hobby Website</title>
<h1>Hello and welcome to my website!</h1>
<h3><div>My name is Amaar. I had graduated from Sheffield Hallam University in 2014 in Interactive Media and Technologies.</div>
<div>I am eager to learn, here are a few examples of current interests I am upskilling in:</div></h3>
<h4><ul>
  <div>C++ Programming</div>
  <div>3D Blender Artist Programme</div>
  <div>Unreal Engine</div>
  <div>AWS SAA & DevOps</div>
</ul></h4>
    <div><p>I am interested in the above because I have an interest in games. And have a creative passion I wish to grasp.<br>When I took courses in ICT, I chased after theory and didn't attempt anything related to creative media.<br>However in recent years I wanted to take advantage of my imagination which I couldn't make tangible through drawing or creating.<br>In terms of programming and coding in game engines, I had touched in many programming languages and their syntaxes.</p></div>

<div><p>As I go through the CYF course, I am chipping away at the blender course in my spare time.<br>My hope is to be a 3D character artist. Mostly as a hobby because I have character design ideas,<br>and I hope to take it further to create animations and event interactive media such as games.</p></div>

<div><p>Through AWS training I want to also create my own portfolio website, but also learn to utilise the technology.<br> I love learning new things, learning new technologies and it's capabilities always encourages me to<br>propel myself to see how I can utilise it.</p></div>
